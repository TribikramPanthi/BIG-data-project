# Multichannel Sales
Multichannel is a business strategy in which retailers interact with potential buyers in several different ways. Multichannel sales refer to the practice by which companies interact with customers via multiple channels, both direct and indirect, in order to sell them goods and services. Companies use direct channels, or ones in which the company proactively reaches the customer – such as physical stores, catalogs or direct mail – or indirect ones in which they push content via websites or social media, also known as inbound marketing.
Big data helps in tracking all customer interacting through multiple channels.
